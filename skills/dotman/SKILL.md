# dotman

This file is an index. Read only the entries your task needs.

## Where the docs live

- `README.md`, `docs/...` and `examples/...` are paths in the dotman repo. A dotman checkout is a repo containing `src/dotman/`; there, read them locally.
- Elsewhere, fetch `https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ewgdg/dotman/<ref>/<path>`. Take `<ref>` from `dotman --version`: the version for a release (`0.9.1`), the hash after `+g` for a dev build (`0.10.5.dev55+ge34356e88` → `e34356e88`), or `main` if neither resolves. Docs at the wrong ref describe flags the installed CLI may lack.
- To list a directory remotely, use `gh api repos/ewgdg/dotman/contents/<dir>?ref=<ref>`.
- `§ Heading` names a section inside that file. `references/...` files ship with this skill.
- For flags, `dotman <command> --help` from the installed CLI is authoritative.

## Operating rules

- Global options go before the command: `dotman --unattended --json <command> ...`. Use `--unattended` to avoid prompts and `--json` when you parse output.
- Run freely: `list`, `info`, `doctor`, `search`, `transform` and `rewrite` to stdout, `render jinja`, and any command with `--dry-run`.
- Every other command (`push`, `pull`, `sync`, `restore`, `track`, `untrack`, `add`, `capture`, `reset`, ...) writes to the user's machine, repo or dotman state. Run one when the task needs its effect, after a `--dry-run` preview where the command has one. `reset sync-base` has no confirmation and no dry-run.
- To apply a change, prefer `sync`: it merges both sides against the Sync Base, while `push` and `pull` overwrite the other side. Unattended Sync leaves both-policy drift without a Base unselected, prints `[skipped] <identity> (no Base)` and still exits 0; resolve that with `push` or `pull` only once you know which side holds the wanted content.
- Leave elevation (sudo) prompts to the user.
- Name targets as `repo:package.target` and package instances as `repo:package<profile>.target`.
- Scope a write command to what changed. Name the targets (`repo:package.target`) when only those files changed; their package hooks still run. A package scope (`dotman pull repo:package`) also covers the packages it depends on, so add `--no-deps` when several targets or a shared input (vars, templates, `package.toml`) changed but the dependencies did not. For `pull`, run `--dry-run` on the package first to find the drifted targets, then narrow (`docs/cli.md` § Sync scope resolution).
- `on_demand = true` targets run only when named exactly (`dotman push repo:package.target`); package selectors and plain `push`/`pull`/`sync` leave them out without any output (`docs/cli.md` § Sync scope resolution).
- `disabled = true` switches a target off entirely: no command runs it, even by exact name, and `info` omits it. Use it to park a target without deleting it; use `on_demand` when it should still run when named.
